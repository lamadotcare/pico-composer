## LAMA Meetings
All LAMA meetings are open to everyone within the Greater Lansing Area and those outside of the area who are want to network about mutual aid.

## What are these meetings for?
We have meetings to get input from the community about

## Meeting Schedule
We generally meet once per week.  We just made some petty big changes, but we will add our new calendar as soon as we sort it out.
Thank you for being patient with us!
